Building this website has been an adventure.  
Well, building it has been easy - most of the work was already taken care of by
other people. The hard part is making it all fit together nicely.

### The hard part
Hardest part was coming up with a name.
My friend Matt helped me with most of the process, and we bounced names off
each other.
I'm not entirely satisfied with it, but I wanted something with my name in it,
and I wanted something about code/programming/tech etc. so, for now,
codeshort.io fits the bill.

### The domain
I've had some experience with NameCheap, so I went looking on there. I bought the
domain for about $30/year, which is pretty standard for the .io top level
domain as far as I know.

### The hosting
Matt told me about GitHub Pages, which provides free hosting and easily
integrates with Jekyll. Jekyll is a static site generator, and there's a bunch
of free, open source themes available that you can use/modify for your GitHub
Pages site.

It's very simple to start a GitHub Pages site, all you need to do is add a
repository called GITHUBUSERNAME.github.io (using your GitHub username).  
Every time you push to that repo, the site rebuilds.  
The site is normally accessible at GITHUBUSERNAME.github.io, but you can also
use a custom domain.

### The security
Either way, since you're hosting at GitHub, setting up SSL is literally just
checking a box. In the Settings page for the repository, check the box that
says "Enforce HTTPS", and you'll have a certificate as soon as it gets
activated.

### The theme
Using Jekyll gives you access to a ton of free themes. I chose the Minimal
Mistakes theme, it's got a good design and it uses the MIT license, which is
nice. There's also great documentation available
[here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

### The wrap-up
That's pretty much it. See ya next time!
